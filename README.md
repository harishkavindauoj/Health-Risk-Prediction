## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning-based health risk prediction system built with R and Shiny. The system predicts the likelihood of various health conditions, including raised blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol issues, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic kidney diseases, based on user-inputted data.

## Features

- Utilizes Random Forest models trained on a health dataset to predict health risks.
- Shiny web application for a user-friendly interface to input data and view predictions.
- Models cover a range of health conditions, providing a comprehensive risk assessment.

## How to Use
